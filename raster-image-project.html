        <p> This is my raster image project. This is a representation of my brain or my hobbies really. The door is supposed to represent the entrance into my brain and the items on the outside are supposed to display what your going to see once you open the door. In this image I wanted to show things that I love and what makes me, me. The two movies posters are supposed to show that I love movies. The house and the blue reminded me of the 1971 film "Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory" which is one of my favorite movies of all time. I put the poster of the 1971 film "Young Frankenstien" on the blue door to represent that I not only love that movie but the blue door is the official entrance to my brain. The picure frame with the black & white picture of the three ladies was a photo taken during the Harlem Renaissance, I chose to put that black & white image in the image because I feel that was such an impactful period in history and I'm from Harlem myself. I chose to put graffiti on the wall so I can give it an urban feel while also having it say importannt words such as risk and peace. I put the "Charging Bull" in the image because my birth sign is a Taurus. I put an old boombox on the steps because I love music and I really love old music. I put black shell toe adidas by the steps to not only display that I love those sneakers but because to a degree I'm a sneaker head. Lastly, I put the "Welcome To New York City" sign by the steps because I'm from New York City. </p>
