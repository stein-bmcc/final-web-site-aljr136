            <p> This is my audio project. The audio project was recorded audio that I had put together with other audio that were from the public domain. The audio represents my morning routine when I'm getting ready for class hence why I titled it "My Morning Routine". The audio is very fast paced and loud because it represents how fast I am when it comes to getting ready. The first music represents a morning vibe and the second music represents a more of a on the go kind of vibe when I'm in the streets heading to school.     </p>
