        <p> This is my vector image project. The illustration is a representation of me during the beginning of the fall semester. The reason I made the illustration appear the way it does because the illustration isn't only a representation on how I appear but my personallity as well. On a daily basis I have a very neutral and serious demeanor. I don't speak much as well hence why I didn't put a mouth on the illustration. I call it "Eyes Without A Face" because I'm usually always quiet and observant in a public setting. </p>
